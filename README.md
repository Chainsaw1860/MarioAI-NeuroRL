# MarioAI-NeuroRL
Neuroevolution and Reinforcement Learning for a Super Mario Bros Playing AI Agent

* this project is highly influenced from two major works
  1. _Play Super Mario Bros with a Double Deep Q-Network_ by Andrew Grebenisan (Python Project)
  2. _Evolution-Guided Policy Gradient in Reinforcement Learning_ by Shauharda Khadka and Kagan Tumer (Scientific Paper)
* also note that chatGPT was also used as a tool for programming 
* the whole project is written in python
* you can find all python files in the directory src
* all scripts can be started from the GUI, if the file GUI.py is started in the same directory e.g. "python MarioAI-NeuroRL/src/GUI.py"
* the file train_models.py can either be started directly e.g. via the batch command "python .../train_models.py" (environment is level 1) or via the GUI (select level for environment)
* in the directory models you can find pre-trained AI models for level 1,2 and 3, they will be used when the test_models.py script is started
